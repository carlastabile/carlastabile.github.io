subtitle: Software Engineer - Developer Advocate

Hello there! 

My name is Carla. I'm originally from Venezuela and I've been living in Spain since 2016. 

I consider myself a [language-agnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-agnostic) software engineer and I'm now a Developer Advocate. I enjoy creating content, going on bike rides and hanging out with my dog Dasha. 

# Now the long story... 
I was born in Venezuela. There I studied Computer Engineering at my beloved alma mater, the [Universidad Sim√≥n Bol√≠var.](http://www.usb.ve/), and in 2016 I moved to Spain to study a Master's in Data Science at [Universitat de Valencia](https://www.uv.es/). 

When I started my professional career I wasn't sure about what I wanted to do. I started as an android developer, I built Ruby on Rails and Django APIs, and after a few years I decided to go to Spain and pursue a Master's in Data Science, which had nothing to do with software development, but I still gave it a try. 

In the meantime, I worked in a few different start-ups and lots of different technologies. Then, I joined [XING](https://www.xing.com/) where I spent almost 4 years and where I grew the most as an engineer. I actually wrote about [my journey to becoming a Sr. Software Engineer there](https://carlastabile.medium.com/my-journey-becoming-a-senior-software-engineer-4ce8f53540bb). 

I started writing in my blog, creating content, and giving talks and realized it was something I truly enjoyed, so I decided to learn more about DevRel and Developer Advocacy. 

In August 2022 I joined Auth0 as a Sr. Developer Advocate ü•π. I'm learning a lot about my new role and I'm very excited for what's coming ahead.
